1. Recap
    - Lev. 1-7: the offerings
    - Lev 11-15: the laws that designated things as clean or unclean

2. Overview of Lev 16
    - **Day of atonement**. This is Yom Kippur. Yom in Hebrew means ‘day’, and Kippur means ‘to atone or cover’. So this means the day of atonement.
    - **High priest**. This is targeted towards the regulations upheld by the High Priest  
        - Echoes Ch. 10, when Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu approach God on their own terms, and die
        - God gives Aaron specific instructions to approach him. To be done **once a year**.
            - Come in linen - symbol of purity
            - Bring offering for himself
            - Bring two goats chosen by lot (one is sacrificed, another is sent out into the wilderness as a scapegoat for the people’s sins)
            - Burn incense, create smoke to cover the mercy seat
            - Sprinkle blood on mercy seat to atone for sins  
    - Lots of Hebrews is a commentary on Lev. 16

3. Main theme: **shadows are real, but they’re not the deeper reality**
    - Shadows are real
        - Psalm 23: “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...”
        - The sacrifices, clean/unclean, instructions for high priests
    - But they’re not the deeper reality
        - Our resurrected bodies

4. First example. **Shadow: Aaron’s priesthood. Reality: Jesus’ priesthood.**
    - God selected Aaron and his line (the Levites) to be priests. Aaron was the high priest. He served as a mediator between God and the Israelites.
    - (Hebrews 7, v11) Perfection cannot be obtained through Levitical priesthood.
        - Another priest through the line of Melchizedek came.
            - Melchizedek discussed in Lev. 7. He had no lineage, was a priest/king, and a portrait of who was to come
            - Melchizedek became king not on basis of blood but on power of indestructible life.
        - When the priest changed, the law must change.
    - Jesus belonged to a different tribe - Judah
        - Moses didn’t say anything about Judah.
        - (Hebrews 7, v 17) You [Jesus] are a priest in the line of Melchizadek.
            - The law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the oath appointed the son who has been made perfect forever.
            - Jesus became a priest with an oath
        - Aaron had to keep repeating the sacrifices year after year because he was imperfect, and because his people kept sinning. But Jesus was blameless, and lives at the right hand of God, acting as our intermediary, interceding on our behalf. He has permanent priesthood.
        - Revelation harkens back to Leviticus when it talks about Jesus’ return: he is dressed in a priestly robe dipped in blood, and his name is the word of God. His armies are dressed in fine linen, white and clean.
            - It’s Jesus’ blood that has secured our place, so we can be white and clean

5. Second example. **Shadow: animal sacrifice. Reality: Jesus’ sacrifice.**
    - How did the High Priest atone for sin?
        - A sin offering. A person would put his hands on the goat, conferring his sins on the animal. Then the animal would go to the priest, and the priest would sacrifice the animal, burn it, would also eat some of it.
            - There’s a transference: people to animal, animal to priest.
            - It’s as if the priest has eaten the sins of the people. He’s participating.
        - On the day of atonement when the high priest goes in in front of the throne room of God, he has to sacrifice for himself, his family, the sanctuary, the alter, and for the people. By his association, by ingesting some of their sin, he also needs atonement/cleansing.
    - **Jesus - our great high priest - is himself also the sacrifice**. And his sacrifice is complete and sufficient. There’s no need for sacrifices anymore.
        - (Hebrews 9 v.11). He entered the most holy place not by the blood of goats, but by his own, obtaining eternal redemption. The blood of goats cleansed the people on the outside; but Christ’s blood cleansed from within.
        - (v. 23) Christ doesn’t enter the holy place - he enters Heaven. And he doesn’t do it year after year, he does it once.
        - (Ch. 10) Jesus was offered for all sins at one time - one sacrifice. He made perfect forever a people who are being made holy
    - The Talmud (ancient Jewish literature) talks about how the priest would put red wool on the scapegoat, and after it went into the wilderness, it would eventually turn white
        - But during the 40 years prior to the destruction of the temple, the red wool didn’t turn white. The destruction of the temple was in 70AD, so this means that from Jesus’ sacrifice to the fall of the temple, the wool didn’t turn white.

6. Third example. **Shadow: earthly tabernacle. Reality: heavenly tabernacle.**
    - In Exodus, Moses got specific instructions to build the tabernacle.
        - A pattern that was shown to him on the mountain
        - Made of pure gold. Two cherubim were made out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover. One cherub at one end, one at the other. The cherubim and the atonement cover/mercy seat were made from one piece 
    - John’s gospel
        - Jesus himself is the new temple.
            - Prologue: the word was God, the word was with God...The Word became became flesh and made his dwelling (tabernacled) with us
        - Jesus says I am the light. The temple was designed to let light out.
        - Jesus fulfills the feast days
        - (Ch 18) Priests say Caesar is their king, and put Jesus to death.
            - Jesus says destroy this temple; in three days I’ll build it again.
        - (Ch 20) After resurrection, John and Peter run to tom- When John gets there, pauses, doesn’t enter, like a priest reluctant to enter the most holy place.
            - Peter catches up, goes in. John goes in after. John believes, seeing the missing body.
            - Peter and John leave. Mary is outside crying, and goes in to see (enters the holy of holies). She sees two angels on either side of where Jesus’ body lay (the mercy seat), one at the head, one at the foot.
                - When she leaves, she’s in a garden. She sees Jesus but thinks he’s a gardener. She goes to hug him, but he says not yet (like a priest warning her not to touch him); tells her to go and tell everyone what she’s seen.
    - (Hebrews 8, 9) Our priest, Christ, is sitting in the true tabernacle, set up by the Lord, not by man....the external regulations are only applied until the new order.
