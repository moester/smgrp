Week 5 - Heart of the Law

Leviticus 18 (couple), 19, 20 (couple)

Detour.  Wrap up.  Sermon entirely on Holiness.  Its God’s heart.  

Holy
 - You are to be holy because I am holy.  Essentially “be like me!”
 - I have set you apart as a people to be my own nation.  (Talking to Israel)  Set apart from sin - set apart to God
 - Our understanding of holiness will only be rich as our understanding of God

You must not do as they do in Egypt (where you came from) and you are not to do as they do in Canaan (where you’re going).  
The place you’re coming from - I dont’ want you to be like them.  The place you’re going - I don’t want you to be like them either.  I want you to be distinct.  I am not like the Gods of Egypt or Canaan (idols).  Remember I am the Lord your God.  Because I’m holy - you are to be Holy.

The place you were delivered from when Jesus found you was a place of darkness.  God is saying “I do NOT want you living the way you did before I found you.”.  And “I do not want you living in the way the culture around you operates.”
So that the world can see a distinct different holy God.

God is showing that he is distinct

What holiness is not
--------------------
- Holiness is not to be compartmentalized.  Holy things and then theres football
- secular vs sacred everything  (job, school, etc)
- whatever it is you’re doing, its God’s mission for you in the context of where you are.  Live your life so that all life is sacred.
- involvement in religious stuff doesn’t guarantee that you’re holy.  (pharisees were whitewashed tombs)
- if your holiness doesn’t translate to the way you behave, it ain’t holy!

What does holiness look like? (lev 19)
--------------------------------------
- respect for your mom and dad.  regardless of they’ve done.  
- complete loyalty to God - radical obedience
- generosity to the poor - reap to edges, go over a second time.  is there room on the edges of your fields to give?  don’t consume all of it yourself.  materialism
- honor relationships.  dont’ steal. dont lie, don’t deceive one another.  don’t swear falsly by God’s name.  God card - “god told me...”  manipulative in nature
- no exploiting people.  there are people you have more power than - don’t exploit them
- legal justice.  do not pervert justice.  don’t show partiality to the poor or favoritism to the great - judge your neighbor fairly.  neither poor nor rich gets special treatment.
- loving your neighbors - yep even yours  (as yourself!)
- sexual purity (chp 18 - every offense possible almost)!
- rejection of worldly and idolatrous (clip hair - divination - cut yourslf - tattoos - mediums and spiritists etc)  these were things that the pagan nations around Israel were doing.  Remember - God wants them to be distinct.  dont do any of that stuff!  something should be different about these people.
- is what we do, and the motivation for what we’re doing, more centerded in on what the world is telling us we need to do, or is it for the purpose of glorifying God?
- don’t let legalism rule here!
- where are you today?  
- respect for elderly, racial respect	
- ethical business practices

What areas of your life have you not brought into the area of holiness?  (compartments?)  What are you gonna do about it?
