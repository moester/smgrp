Leviticus 25
------------
  - Sabbath year - define  (6 years sow/gather.  don’t sow or prune, or reap or harvest.)  
  - define sabbath perhaps?
  - 1 day a week, and 1 year out of 7.  let the land rest
  - how will we eat?
    - god will send such a blessing in 6th year that the’ll eat for the next 3.
    - still be eating from it when the harvest from the 9th year comes in.
  - why?  god is teaching the nations around israel something about himself

Jubilee
-------
  - count off 7 sabbaths of years 7x7 years, blow trumpets on day of atonement, consecrate the 50th year and proclaim liberty to all inhabitants.  
  - dont sow, or reap.
  - jubilee is to be holy
  - Freedom or release from bondage
    - Reset!
      - property given back
      - slaves freed (hired workers essentially)
      - debts forgiven

Application
-----------
  - everything is Gods, and he can be trusted (leave the land alone, god will provide)
  - hope and justice isnt too far away - jubilee is coming. great reset (fall on hard times, sell property, sell themselves)
  - God’s economy is more relational than financial.  (begins on day of Atonement)


No Jubilee
----------
  - Israel has no record of ever keeping the Jubilee.
  - 2 Chron 36 - land enjoyed its sabbath rest (70 years).  time from israel stopped observing till exile - 490 years

Other scriptures
----------------
  - Isaiah 61
    - Lord has appointed me to proclaim the year of the Lords favor (Jubilee)
  - Luke 4
    - Jesus as Guest Rabbi - stops at “to proclaim the year of the Lords Favor”.  Stops.  Today, this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.  I am the Jubilee!

    - I can release you from all of your debts
    - I can make everything new
    - I can reset you into the image in which you were designed
  - Matthew 1:17
    - 14 gens from abraham to david, 14 from david to exile in babylon, and 14 from exile to the Christ.  3 14s, 6 7s.   *Jesus is the 7th 7.  He is the Jubilee.


Hey there Pastor Jerry,
You mentioned in a Leviticus sermon that Matthew 1:17 states that there are 14 generations from Abraham to David, 14 generations from David to the exile, and 14 from the exile to the Messiah.  So three14s, or six 7s - where Jesus is the seventh 7 (or the Jubiliee).  But wouldn't that make him instead the 43rd generation and not the Jubilee?  
My small group has been studying Leviticus through the Distinct series from the Chapel.  This week is the sermon on Jubilee, and I know some have already asked this question.

Hi Dave:
 
Matthew was employing a literary device more than anything.  His genealogy (which likely skipped some generations as most all ancient genealogies did) was to show this was a real event and that the Messiah is the "seventh seven" (in terms of how he ordered his gospel).  John does something similar in ordering the miracles in his gospel - its common practice in the ancient world.  so, read it as a literary aficianado more than a scientist :-). This isn't a math formula, it's a literary device to show that Jesus is the ultimate perfection, the perfect rest, and the Savior from sin.  He is the Jubilee.
 
Hope that helps.  Say hi to your group for me.
 
Grace and Peace,
