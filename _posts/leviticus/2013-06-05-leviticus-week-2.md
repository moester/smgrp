1. Recap
  - Leviticus is instructions for Israel to be able to dwell with a holy God, on God’s terms. 
  - Chs. 8-10 are about the ordination of the priesthood.

2. Chs. 11-15 are about what’s clean and unclean. Covers many aspects - we’ll focus on food.
	- Covers which animals you can and can’t eat
	- Covers animals in the ground, air and sea
	- There’s lots of detail here: you can eat ground animals that chew the cud and have split hooves; you can eat water animals with fins and scales; etc.
	- There’s a parallel: in Genesis 1:20-25, God speaks of animals in the same categories (ground, air, sea).
		- Here he tells us that all of creation is good. In Leviticus, he is telling us which parts of creation are clean and unclean. Note the distinction.

3. Summary of Ch. 11 is in verses 44-45: “consecrate yourselves” (set yourselves apart). “You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.”

4. In chapters 12-15, God lists ways his people can be ceremonially unclean and defile themselves. He covers the realms of food, mildew, skin diseases, and many other things.
  - But the good news is that he also makes it clear that if we do become unclean, there’s a way for us to become clean again.
  	- Some things take longer, some shorter
		- E.g., Lev. 11:24-25, “unclean until evening”.
	- The point is, if we are unclean, we are not to approach the tabernacle until we are clean again. 

5. How did God decide what was clean and what was unclean?
	- Moses is probably putting into words what was already understood by the culture. Even as early as Genesis, this notion was understood
		- Recall Genesis 4:1-5, the story of Cain and Abel. Cain brought only some of his portions to the Lord, but Abel brought fat portions from his own flock. So the Lord looked favorably on Abel - which made Cain angry.
		- How did Cain and Abel know the difference? Maybe God told Adam, and it’s just outside of the bible. Maybe the laws were just passed down verbally. In any case, somehow they knew them. 
		- By the time you get to Noah, you see the same thing.
			- In Genesis 7, God tells Noah to take 7 of every kind of *clean* animal, and 2 of every kind of *unclean* animal.
	- So the people of Genesis understood the distinction between clean/unclean (note this is not about healthy vs. unhealthy). But why are some chosen? How did they know? Why some diseases and not others? Why some types of bodily functions and not others?
		- Most commentators don’t have a strong opinion about why this happened. It seems that God has done this for his own reasons. Jerry thinks they are reminders that God wants to set apart his people, to be distinct.
		- If you were a priest and went to the tabernacle and were unclean, you were dead.  So this was serious - you’ve got to approach God on God’s terms.
			- Consider the building of the tabernacle from Exodus 26:14. The top layer was made of hides of sea cows - which are unclean. But what stood between the outer, unclean layer, and the holiness of god? A ram’s skin - dyed red. This is quite a picture, and will become more clear when we read about Jesus in Hebrews.

6. The symbols of cleanliness can become reality
	- The animals weren’t inherently clean or unclean - they were all good, as all of creation is good. But some animals being set aside as clean and some as unclean are symbols of God’s story playing out.
	- For the Israelites, these symbols became their reality. 
		- Century after century, God wanted the symbols to be apparent to both his people and other cultures - as a visible distinction.
		- But the Israelites began to focus exclusively on the symbols, and neglected what the symbols represented.

7. What happens when symbols become reality? You need reality to break in - Jesus. 
	- Jesus confronted the religious leaders of his time
		- In Mark 7:14: “Nothing outside a man can make him unclean by going into him; rather it is what comes out of a man that makes him unclean.” And later, “‘...whatever goes into a person from the outside cannot defile him, since it enters not his heart but his stomach, and is expelled’ Thus [Jesus] declared all foods clean.” And “...all these evils come from inside, and make a man unclean”.
	- Jesus tells them it’s not just about the symbols - it’s about the heart behind the symbols
		- If you eat unclean food (pork, for instance), that itself doesn’t make you unclean. It’s that you’ve eaten it and defied God - you have a heart issue with submitting to His authority. You’re not coming to God on God’s own terms.
	- Jesus tells them that he has come to fulfill all of God’s terms
		- He tells them that now, what matters is faith in the son of God, faith with your heart
		- Jesus’ ministry is full of him fulfilling these terms
			- One time there was a woman with an issue of blood. She touched him. Did that make him unclean? No - it made her clean.
			- Jesus sees a man with leprosy - a skin disease. Jesus touches the man, and it makes the man clean.
			- Jesus sees a young man who’s dead. He lays his hands on the coffin - but this doesn’t make him unclean, it brings life to the young man.
		- **In Jesus, reality breaks in where symbols used to live**.
		- Paul also discusses Jesus’ role in breaking through symbols
			- Collisions 2:8: “Do not be held captive to human tradition...” “He...forgave us all our sins having canceled the written code with its regulations that were against us and that stood opposed to us. He took it away, nailing it to the cross...therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink...these are a shadow of the things to come, but the reality belongs to Christ.”

8. We are all unclean, and we have symbols that we use to try to cleanse ourselves
	- Lady Macbeth is a great illustration of this. In the play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth’s conscience convicts her so much that she begins to sleep walk and sleep talk; she tries to wipe her hands clean of blood, even though there’s no blood on them. But the blood had not stained her hands - it had dyed her conscience. This is another way of understanding that the outward ritual of making things clean won’t work.
		- Jesus - the playwright - becomes the lead actor.
	- What outward actions do we do to try to satisfy stains on our heart?
		- Going to church
		- Spoiling our kids
		- Tithing
		- We’re doing the same thing that raving mad Lady Macbeth was doing - but there’s nothing on our hands. Our hearts are stained. We need Jesus. 
		- Hebrews 10: “...having our hearts sprinkled, to cleanse us from a guilty conscience”
	- Distinct people aren’t religious; distinct people are people who embrace Jesus. Jesus is the only way to come to God - the only way.
