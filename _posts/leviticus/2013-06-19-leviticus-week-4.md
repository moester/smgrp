1. Recap
  - God is distinct/holy, He wants a distinct/holy people. He wants his people to be so distinct that others know He is different + set apart.
  - Shadows are real, but they’re not the deeper reality. The instructions that God gave the Israelites in Leviticus are real, but they’re only a shadow of the depeer reality, which is fulfilled in Jesus.

2. The Day of Atonement was a big day for Israel. It was when the High Priest mediated on behalf of the people, to atone for their sins.
  - So why didn’t Jesus die on this day?
  - 7 feasts (Leviticus 23), split into Spring and Autumn feasts.
  - The Spring feasts were fulfilled in Jesus
    - Passover: God passes over the houses with blood on the door, spares the first child. Fulfilled in Christ: 1st Corinth Ch. 5: “Christ, our Passover Lamb has been sacrificed”. Christ’s sacrifice means God’s judgement passes us over.
    - Unleavened bread: symbol of non-decay. Fulfilled in Christ: Acts 2 (Peter speaking about Christ): “...nor will you let your holy one see decay”. Jesus wouldn’t let his body decay. 
    - First fruits: brought the first fruits of the harvest to the priest. Fulfilled in Christ: the resurrection. 1st Corinth. Ch. 15: “Christ has been risen again, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep”.
    - Weeks: 7 weeks (50 days) after first fruits. Present new grain - this was about newness and creation. Fulfilled in Christ: Acts 2, day of Pentecost, they were all together & there was a new creation of the church.
    - The Spring feasts signified all the Jesus did, not only chronologically in the same order, but on the same day. Jesus died on Passover. He rose on the first fruits. 50 days later was Pentecost.
    - The Autumn feasts contained the Day of Atonement
      - Feast of trumpets (Rosh Hashanah): do no work, present an offering of fire. Precedes the day of atonement by 10 days.
        - What was the Day of Atonement really about? Lev. 23. Nobody’s working on this day - and if you choose to work, you would be cut off from your people. 
        - There were two responses: celebration or judgement. Some people were excited to see the priest come out of the holy of holies, since they had been following the law. But others had not, so they were in fear of judgement & being cut off.
        - But this seems unfair - shouldn’t those who are disobedient get a warning? They do - the feast of trumpets. Trumpets are typically used to remind people of something. So for ten days leading up to Yom Kippur, trumpets were blaring, reminding the people to repent of their sins.
        - The Jewish people called these ten days the Days of Awe. They were in awe that God gave them a way to tabernacle with them without being consumed by his holiness.
        - We also see trumpets in Revelation 8-9. With each trumpet, we see a sign - signs of awe. Locusts, hail and fire, oceans of blood, etc. And just like in Lev., these aren’t about judgement. They are warning signs, so the people can recognize their sins & repent.
          - In Rev 11, we see again the holy of holies and the ark - we’re being let in to be with God. It represents the second coming.
          - Similar in Hebrews 9: “Christ entered Heaven itself...he will appear a second time”. Also Hebrews 10: “encourage each other all the more as you see the day approaching”.
3. At some point, the high priest (Jesus) will exit the holy of holies (return to Earth), and again there will be two responses. Either you will have longed for his appearance, or you will be afraid of his judgement (Hebrews 10 - fearful expectation of judgement).
