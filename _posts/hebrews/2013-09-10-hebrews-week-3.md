## 1. Refresher

- Written to 1st-century urbanites
- Question that Hebrews answers: Why is our life so hard?
- Answer: Focus on Jesus

## 2. Rest

- The importance of it
- The levels of it
- The ordeal of it
- The author of it

## 3. The importance of rest

- V3 is a quote from Psalm 95. Recounting when children of Egypt are in the wilderness, on their way to Canaan. They begin to turn away from God.
  - What's the worst possible punishment for this? No rest. Rest is fundamental to the human condition: life, joy, etc.
  - Anecdote: Judith Shulevitz, author from NYTimes, writes how in her teenage years she stopped going to Synagogue on Sundays, but as an adult started coming back because she felt restless. She then writes our relationship to work is seriously out of wack, and that Church had kept our workaholism in check for thousands of years.
- Sabbath - rest - is one of the ten commandments. A society that encourages overwork is as brutalizing as a society that encourages stealing, adultery and killing. It's in the same list.
- We're one of the most over-worked (if not *the* most overworked) societies in history. Why?
  1. Technology means our work is more accessible to us. It's also made our world shrunk - more competition.
  2. Cultural explanation. In traditional societies, your identity and values came from your family. Our culture is the most individualistic in history - we're free to be who we want to be, but this means we have to earn our own way, rather than just inheriting a reputation from our family. So work becomes a way for us to get our values and worth now.  
      - Our families are no longer the chief benefit of our work. They've become a means for our own personal achievement
      - "In a society that measures status in achievement, in grades, awards, brand-name colleges, the scramble for advantage is bound to propel us into over-parenting. Over-parenting is closely linked to over-work, and it's harder to opt out than you think. For now we use our children to jockey for our individual status."
      - So things have reversed. It used to be that I worked to get my family ahead, now it's: I use my family in order to get my own individual status.
- As a result, we're tired.

## 4. The two levels of rest

- This passage is actually hard to read, because the word 'rest' is used in very different ways
  1. The rest of the promised land
      - In v3, God warned the children of Israel they wouldn't get the physical and emotional rest that they sought in Canaan
      - In Egypt, they were slaves. Deut. 15, "Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and that the Lord your God brought you out with a mighty hand...therefore, the Lord has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day"
      - Resting is a declaration of freedom. Anyone who overworks is a slave, to our society and its values. God brought the Israelites out of Egypt, out of that society.
  2. The rest that comes from believing the Gospel
      - v5 talks about God resting. But does God rest the way we do? What does it mean?
      - The context helps, Gen. 2:2, it means God was satisfied with what he was doing. He said, "it is good" and "it is finished."
      - Analogy: our own sleep at night has these same two levels. We need more than just time spent laying down, we need the deeper, REM sleep. This is what we really need, and no amount of vacations can cure our restlessness if we don't learn how to get to that.
      - Shulevitz, again ([link][1]): "Most people believe all you have to do to stop working is not work. The inventors of the Sabbath understood, though, that it was a much more complicated undertaking to rest. You cannot downshift casually and easily. This is why the Purtian and Jewish Sabbaths were so exactingly intentional. Even our secular leisure activities cannot do for us what Sabbath rituals can do. For religious rituals do not exist to promote togetherness. They are designed to convey to us a certain story about who we are. The story told by the Sabbath is that of creation: God rested and we rest in order to honor the image of the divine in us, to remind us that there is more to us than our work. The machinery of self-censorship must shut down too, in order to rest, stilling the eternal inner murmer of self-reproach."  
          - She's saying it's one thing to stop your physical activity, but the inner rest is being at rest with who you are.
          - No matter how good we do at our work, how much we accomplish, we will die, and if we don't find rest from that, we are merely slaves, to our social systems, to the expectations of others and ourselves
      - The rest that comes from believing the Gospel
          - v2 and v3 talk about this
          - v8 says explains is the rest we really need: Joshua got the Israelites into the promised land, and if that was all they needed, God wouldn't have continued to warn them about the potential for missing the deeper rest

## 5. The ordeal of rest

- There is a horrible ordeal we have to go through in order to get this deeper rest
  - v12 and v13: the spirit knows our inner thoughts and attitudes, and because of this we'll feel utterly naked (literal translation of uncovered) before God.
- How is this connected to the idea of rest?
  - You will never experience into deep rest unless you come to grips with the experience of spiritual nakedness
    - Hearkens back to Genesis 3. Adam and Eve were naked and unashamed - because they were at rest and satisfied with who they were. But the minute we turn from God, and decide to be our own Lords, we experience a sense of inadequacy and spiritual nakedness
- Franz Kafka, The Trial. Man wakes up under arrest, first thinks there's a rational explanation, but the more he tries to right the wrong, the deeper he gets, until he's killed.
  - This is like our situation. We think there's an explanation for our restlessness - but there's a voice inside, telling us there's something wrong with us, that we're not acceptable. We call it complexes, we blame it on our parents, on society...but we can't get rid of it. There must be a rational explanation, we don't believe in sin or guilt. But deep inside, we know there's something wrong with us.
  - Are we driven to do too much? Some of us can't imagine not being attractive, or being with someone attractive. Some of us always want to work to get to the next level, because once we get there we'll be alright - except when we get there, we're not alright. These are all just fig leaves. What are we trying to cover up?
- v10 says we get rest from our own work. But what's wrong with work?
  - Paul says: there's nothing wrong with work. What's wrong is the reason for our work, when our work is self-justified.
  - If we're doing work to feel good about ourselves, you'll never be able to lay it down and say, 'it is good'
  - This is why John Gerstner says, "The main thing between you and God is not your sins; it's your damnable good works."
  - Just repenting of sins does not get at the self-justifying reasons behind your actions.
    - If you work and work and work, then get worn out, then feel spiritually dry, then tell yourself that you're going to start spending time with your bible and at church, realize that it's the same thing! It's just a religious form of self-justification.

## 6. The author of rest
- How do we get there? v13, second word: "laid bare" really means "to stretch the neck back so you could cut it and kill". This is how animals were sacrificed at the temple. This is serious imagery.
  - If there really is a God of justice, we're all going to be cut off
- Yet, the very next verse, v14 says, "He his a high priest; go to him, and he will give you grace and mercy in time of need".
- So how can 12 and 13 talk about us being cut off, and 14 and 15 talk about God being the high priest for us?
  - That is the answer: we are not the sacrifice, because he was the sacrifice.
  - Jesus was cut off from the land of the living; radically stripped naked on the cross. He experienced radical, cosmic restlessness, so we could have rest.
  - When Jesus died, he said "it is finished."
  - Matt. 11, Jesus says "Come to me and I will give you rest"
- You can lay down your work, and walk away from it, because you're absolutely sure about who you are, because you're delighted in by the only set of eyes in the universe to which you have to give an account.
- v11 indicates there's something in the future (v3 is present tense). The full rest is in the new heavans and the new earth. But it's also saying that you never get the full rest, you have to keep going back to the Gospel to get rest.
  - Analogy: fireplace in a cold house. Sometimes we get busy, drift away from the fire. But when we do, instead of making longer lists and working harder, we need to come back to the fire.
  - Richard Loveless: "If we start each day with our personal security resting our present achievements, such arguments will not quiet the human conscience so we are inevitably moved to discouragement and apathy or to a self righteousness or some sort of idolatry which tries to falsify the record to achieve some sense of peace. But “If we start each day with our personal security resting on the accepting love of God and the sacriﬁce of Christ [we will know] gospel faith which is able to warm itself at the ﬁre of God’s love and what Jesus has done for us, instead of having to steal love from all these other sources - go to the ﬁre, gain peace, lay your work down."
