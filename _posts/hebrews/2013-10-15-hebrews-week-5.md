## 1. Refresher

- Written to 1st-century urbanites
- Question that Hebrews answers: Life is hard - how do we get through it?
- Answer: Focus on Jesus. Be counseled and encouraged.

## 2. Jesus is our advocate

Hebrews is not a piece of abstract theological writing; it is practical, like pastoral counseling. And the author here is saying that some of the most practical advice we can get is that we have an advocate in Jesus.

Let's look at three things:

1. Why do we need an advocate?
2. Why is Jesus the advocate that we need?
3. What difference will it make to us if we receive him as such?


## 3. Why do we need an advocate?

1. v18-19. Speaks as if everyone is using priests to draw closer to God, but Jesus is the better priest.
  - The problem with this - not everyone today is seeking God!
  - But look at v.25. Intercede doesn't always mean priests to God. Also has a legal meaning: to appear as a representative in court for someone who's on trial.

2. We all hold conceptions of ourselves in our minds.
  - A woman from the NYTimes writes: "More than 40 years of looking at myself in the mirror have left me like so many other people I know: almost totally ignorant of what I really look like. In the mirror I see not reality but a composite of memories, wishes, half-truths. I've learned to live with my shadowy self-image. I know there's a real me lurking somewhere, though I can't see her."
  - The physical. We don't keep pictures we don't like. We don't even look in the mirror at ourselves at certain angles. So we walk around with an image in our head of what we hope we look like to people.
  - The spiritual. We don't only do this for the physical. We walk around with an image of what we're like as a person: good or bad, caring or selfish...

3. But, we cannot live with only our own concepts of ourselves. We need pronouncement from outside.
  - Deep down we are scared of what we really are.
  - But we hope that we get the verdicts from the outside of what we have in our head.
  - Arthur Miller, playwright. Quentin in "After the Fall" says: "For many years I looked at life like a case at law. It was a series of proofs. When you're young you prove how brave you are, or smart; then, what a good lover; then, a good father; finally, how wise, or powerful or [whatever.] But underlying it all, I see now, there was a presumption. That one moved ... on an upward path toward some elevation, where ... God knows that ... I would be justified, or even condemned. A verdict anyway. I think now that my disaster really began when I looked up one day ... and the bench was empty. No judge in sight. And all that remained was the endless argument with oneself, this pointless litigation of existence before an empty bench... Which, of course, is another way of saying - despair."
  - We cannot be satisfied with our own judgments - we need to get them from outside.

4. Why?

  - Romans explains: Whether you admit with your mind or not, your heart knows that there is a God.
  - The reason we're seeking outside pronouncements is because there really is a God sitting on the bench, which we will appear before.
  - Are we going to go alone? How many people win court cases when they represent themselves? Probably none, outside of the movies. It's a bad idea.

5. So we need an advocate.

## 4. Why Jesus?

v.24-25. We're coming before God with Jesus interceding for us.

1. Importance of an advocate
  - What does everyone look at in court? The advocate. Its his eloquence and brilliance that matters, not yours. His talents and characteristics get imputed to you.
  - The advocate is not just an example - he comes inside of you, and is you. He's your substitute.
2. Christianity is: Jesus as our substitute - not our example
3. Christ is the ultimate advocate, standing before the ultimate judge presiding over the only trial that counts

4. How does this work?

  - When Keller first heard this idea, he didn't find comfort in it. He thought, as an analogy, every day Jesus would bring Keller's binder full of papers before God, pleading his latest sins be forgiven, throwing himself at the mercy of God, and God would reluctantly bestow forgiveness, for Jesus' sake.

    - But if this is the intercessory work of Jesus, how long can he keep it up?

  - But this is not how it works. An effective attorney has a case. According to this passage, Jesus is not up there asking for mercy. Asking for mercy means you've lost the case.

    - v.27-28 tells us. Jesus is telling God that we're guilty - but that he paid the debt. So, justice is to give them freedom. Jesus is demanding justice on our behalf. And because God is righteous, justice demands he completely accept and embrace us throughout all eternity. 

    - This is an infallible case.

5. With this in mind - how do our own comparisons stack up? Comparing ourselves to people we see in life, or on tv, or at work.

  - 1 John 1:8-9, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins." Notice it says just - not merciful.

6. Should this change our life? Yes!

  - High priests were beautiful - covered in jewels. Jesus is our high priest. So when God looks at us, he doesn't just see us plainly in his mercy - he sees us beautifully. Being a Christian is not just a matter of forgiveness and pardon. It means that in Him, we're absolute beauties. We shouldn't ever just focus on the negative.

  - Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones: "To make it quite practical I have a very simple test. After I have explained the way of Christ to somebody I say “Now, are you ready to say that you are a Christian?” And they hesitate. And then I say, “What’s the matter? Why are you hesitating?” And so often people say, “I don’t feel like I’m good enough yet. I don’t think I’m ready to say I’m a Christian now.” And at once I know that I have been wasting my breath. They are still thinking in terms of themselves. They have to do it. It sounds very modest to say, “Well, I don’t think I’ good enough,” but it’s a very denial of the faith. The very essence of the Christian faith is to say that He is good enough and I am in Him. As long as you go on thinking about yourself like that and saying, “I’m not good enough; Oh, I’m not good enough,” you are denying God – you are denying the gospel – you are denying the very essence of the faith and you will never be happy. You think you’re better at times and then again you will find you are not as good at other times than you thought you were. You will be up and down forever. How can I put it plainly? It doesn’t matter if you have almost entered into the depths of hell. It does not matter if you are guilty of murder as well as every other vile sin. It does not matter from the standpoint of being justified before God at all. You are no more hopeless than the most moral and respectable person in the world."

## 5. How does embracing Jesus as our advocate change our life?

1. You get a completely new identity
  - Everyone is on trial, whether you believe it or not. And everyone is going to choose something other than themselves as their advocate. Choosing Jesus makes us look beautiful before God.

2. You get a total abolition of guilt
  - We all have moments where we reflect on our mistakes and start judging ourselves. Jesus makes it so we don't have to feel guilty.

3. It deeply undermines your disappointments and discouragements
  - Why not abolish? Life is filled with disappointments. Jesus walked around weeping and crying, and we will too. But so often our deepest discouragements come places where we are trying to find our worthiness.
  - Our deepest discouragements come from the fact that we try to be to ourselves what only Jesus can be for us.

4. It suffuses your life with playfulness
  - If you're a very religious person, when someone criticizes you, you are either broken or you get angry at them.
  - But the Gospel says if somone were to criticize us, we'd laugh at them and say "you don't know the half of it."

5. It gives you a foundation for complete courage
  - Acts 7, Stephen about to be executed, he looked up in Heavan, his face shown like an angel, and he said, "Father, don't hold them against them." We're told he saw the majesty on high and Jesus Christ standing at the right-hand of the father. He saw Jesus as his advocate. Interesting, because at the moment an earthly court was condemning him, the only court that mattered was commending him. This meant he didn't care what the court down here was doing.
    - He had a complete courage. IT wasn't angry or defiant - it was of complete grace.
