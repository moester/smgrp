		<h2>Outline</h2>
		<div id="outline-content">
			<h2>1. Refresher</h2>

<ul>
<li>Written to 1st-century urbanites</li>
<li>Question that Hebrews answers: Lfe is hard - how do we get through it?</li>
<li>Answer: Focus on Jesus. Be counseled and encouraged.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Counseling</h2>

<ul>
<li>v3:13 says we are to exhort/counsel one another every day

<ol>
<li>Why do we need counseling?</li>
<li>What kind of counseling do we need?</li>
<li>Who can give it to us?</li>
<li>How do we receive it?</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Why do we need it</h2>

<ul>
<li>In 3:7, author tells his audience not to be like the Israelites in the wilderness

<ul>
<li>The wilderness was an arid dessert</li>
<li>(Ex 17) The Israelites were thirsty, complained, doubted God</li>
<li>We shouldn&#39;t be like them!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Analogy: we&#39;re in a spiritual wilderness. Two similarities:

<ol>
<li>You&#39;ll die if you try to fulfill your deepest needs with the wrong stuff. Dessert: your livestock will die, not enough water, etc. Our life: family, career, money, friendship. We all know this - the second we get something we wanted, we thought we needed, it begins to slip away.</li>
<li>More often than not, God will not seem to be doing things the way you want them done. He&#39;ll seem like he doesn&#39;t care, or like he&#39;s not around.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Implications of these two things? Your heart will become hardened (v8). And this is why we need daily, constant counseling (v13).</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. What kind of counseling do we need</h2>

<ul>
<li>Many commentators say Hebrews seems schizofrenic

<ul>
<li>We need counseling, yet Hebrews can be stern (end of Ch.3: &quot;Don&#39;t turn, don&#39;t have a sinful heart, let the fate of the Israelites be a lesson to you.&quot;).</li>
<li>But then it swings back: (v16) &quot;Approach the throne with utter confidence.&quot; </li>
</ul></li>
<li>This is actually how Jesus was at times

<ul>
<li>Lazarus, both Martha and Mary say almost the same thing to Jesus: &quot;If you were here, our brother wouldn&#39;t have died&quot;.</li>
<li>His response to Martha: &quot;I am the resurrection.&quot; He challenges her.</li>
<li>His response to Mary: weeping.</li>
<li>(Aside: this is a strange behavior, seems unlikely to have been made up)</li>
<li>What does it mean? Jesus is equally adept at the ministry of truth and the ministry of tears. Who denies that we all need both? (Keller says anyone with kids does, at least).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We need both truth and pity. We won&#39;t listen to a truth teller who doesn&#39;t weep with us, but the only tears worth shedding are those from a truth teller.

<ul>
<li>All of us are either weepers or fixers, but Jesus is equally both. And since we all need both, we all need Jesus&#39; counseling.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Who gives us counseling?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Jesus is the ultimate counselor. v4:15 gives us two reasons why

<ol>
<li>Jesus was tempted in every way</li>
<li>Keller tells a story of a doctor who had poor bedisde manner. Keller came back in a few years later and got the same doctor, but he was radically more pleasant. He asked why, and the doctor said he had a kidney stone and had to be a patient himself, lying on the table. Once he realized what they go through, he changed.</li>
<li>Christianity is the only religion that says our God has been on the table. Jesus knows grief, misunderstanding, loss, pain, torture, death.</li>
<li>Jesus was without sin</li>
<li>Someone may say that this means he cannot experience what we experience</li>
<li>But this is wrong, because it&#39;s sin that keeps us from understanding others&#39; perspectives and experiences. Jesus is perfect love, so he understands us completely. He lets himself be drained to understand us more. Look at his ministry - he is often crying and sighing with people.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Keller&#39;s favorite example of Jesus&#39; perfect counseling: woman caught in adultury in John 8. They&#39;re about to stone her, and Jesus says &quot;Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.&quot; But then he looks at her and says &quot;neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more.&quot; This is the ultimate counselor at work: both sides, pity and rebuke. And he doesn&#39;t base his love for her on whether she stops sinning. He wants her to base her behavior on his love.

<ul>
<li>How can Jesus be so unconditionally loving, yet have a complete hatred of sin? This is really amazing, and is exactly what we need. How is it possible? v5:6: You are a priest in the order of Melchizedek. In the old testament, there was never a priest-king. The King represented the God to the people (told and enforced the law), and the priest represented the people to God (caregiver, supporter). So how could you possibly combine these two? The King was the person of truth, the priest the person of tears.</li>
<li>There is one place - Melchizedek, a King who offers sacrifices to the Lord.</li>
<li>The cross brings this to a head. 5:7 refers to Jesus crying out on the cross. Infinite love was honoring infinite justice and truth.</li>
<li>If Jesus was all truth, he wouldn&#39;t have died for us.</li>
<li>If he was all pity, he wouldn&#39;t have died, he would have accepted us and given up changing us.</li>
<li>John Newton: &quot;To see the law by love fulfilled and hear his pardoning voice / transforms a slave into a child and duty into choice.&quot;</li>
<li>The woman in John 8 is guilty, but Jesus doesn&#39;t condemn her. How is this possible? <strong>Because he took the condemnation.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>6. How do we receive this counseling?</h2>

<p>Three ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>You need to be saved. Is Christ your personal counselor? Does Christ, because of his tears, tell you the truth?</li>
<li>You need communal sanctification. What does this mean? v13, counsel one another daily.</li>
<li>You need duration. v5:7 says when Jesus was crying out to God, he was heard. But didn&#39;t he go to the cross? The resurrection.</li>
</ol>

 <p id="p58005001.01-2"><span class="chapter-num" id="v58005001-2">5:1&nbsp;</span>For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. <span class="verse-num" id="v58005002-2">2&nbsp;</span>He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is beset with weakness. <span class="verse-num" id="v58005003-2">3&nbsp;</span>Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins just as he does for those of the people. <span class="verse-num" id="v58005004-2">4&nbsp;</span>And no one takes this honor for himself, but only when called by God, just as Aaron was.</p>
