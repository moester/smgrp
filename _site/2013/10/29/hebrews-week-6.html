		<h2>Outline</h2>
		<div id="outline-content">
			<h2>1. Refresher</h2>

<ul>
<li>Written to 1st-century urbanites</li>
<li>Question that Hebrews answers: Life is hard - how do we get through it?</li>
<li>Answer: Focus on Jesus. Be counseled and encouraged.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Intro</h2>

<ul>
<li>An aside: Keller was preparing for a talk on the subject: &quot;Does religion cause holy war?&quot; He first thought it was an unfair question, but then came to believe it was true. And what does Hebrews have to say about it?

<ul>
<li>One of the main points of Hebrews is: Jesus Christ did not come to start a new religion. He came to end religion. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This text tells us two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Jesus came to end all religion</li>
<li>Therefore, Jesus gave us a radical new covenant relationship with God</li>
</ol>

<h2>3. Jesus came to end all religion</h2>

<p>Ch8v1-2. Two things different about this priesthood than any other. &quot;This priest sits at the right hand of the throne&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li>Jesus is a priest king</li>
<li>Jesus is seated</li>
</ol>

<p>Religion is strong, and growing.</p>

<ul>
<li>All religions believe in two things:

<ol>
<li>Behind the realities of nature, there&#39;s an &#39;ultimate&#39; reality</li>
<li>There&#39;s some gap that needs to be bridged, and we need some mediator to bridge that gap</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Lots of variety among religions as to how these are accomplished</li>
<li>And it seemed like religion was becoming increasingly irrelevant</li>
<li>But in recent years religion has been making a comeback</li>
<li>In academia (Stanley Fish quote). Many academics used to think you could explain all things through science/empirical observation.</li>
<li>But (CS Lewis) if you keep explaining things away, you explain away explanation. &quot;To see through everything is not to see.&quot;

<ul>
<li>Niezche: All claims of God are really just power plays. (But this is a claim of God)</li>
<li>Freud: All claims of absolute truth in God are really just psychological projection dealing w/guilt and insecurity. (This claim would be a projection)</li>
<li>Evolutionary biologists: Your brain tells you there&#39;s a GOd and absolute truth, but that&#39;s just a chemical response. (Their claims about evolution is just a chemical response)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This means that the majority of the human race will accept that there&#39;s an ultimate reality we can&#39;t see through, there&#39;s an ultimate reality that&#39;s there, and everyone will feel the gap and look to religion to deal with it.</li>
<li>Religion is growing. This is a problem, because religion brings conflict</li>
<li>So why not stamp out religion? Some societies have tried that - usually end up being more brutal</li>
</ul>

<p>Having understood this, let&#39;s come back to see how Jesus came to end religion.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jesus is a priest-king. King: represents God to the people. Priest: represents people to God. What does this mean?

<ul>
<li>Jesus <em>is</em> the ultimate reality on the other side of the gap. Look at Ch.1. Creation. John Ch. 2 &quot;tear down this body&quot;.</li>
<li>Every other religion has a founder that says &quot;I am the teacher pointing to the ultimate reality&quot; or &quot;I am the ultimate teacher pointing to the ultimate reality&quot;. Jesus says &quot;I am the ultimate reality!&quot; Nobody&#39;s ever said that.</li>
<li>But Jesus is also the Priest, meaning he&#39;s also the bridge over the gap. His life, death and resurrection is the bridge to the divine. Paul in Collossions 1: &quot;Once you were alienated from God (gap), but now he has reconciled you by Christ&#39;s body through death to present you perfect in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation.&quot;</li>
<li>Every other religion says: do this, give this, offer this, live this way, exprience this, and that will send you over hte gap to God. Jesus says I am the God that has come over the gap to you, the gap that no religion could ever cross.</li>
<li>This is why Jesus is seated - because all religious work is done. Jesus says I conclude the work of religion. Final priest, final temple, final sacrifice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rome allowed a multitude of religions to exist, yet they persecuted Christians and called them atheists. Why? They knew that Christianity was not the beginning of a new religion, it was the end to religion.

<ul>
<li>Hypothetical conversation beween Roman and Christian</li>
<li>Religion says: &quot;live like this, and God will accept you&quot;. Jesus says, &quot;God has accepted you because of me. Now live like this.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Jesus brings us a new covenant relationship with God</h2>

<ol>
<li>What&#39;s a covenant?

<ul>
<li>We don&#39;t have a good English word for it. Might think of contract - but this is not good.</li>
<li>In the Bible, the most intimate relationships were binding and legal. Our culture sees a separation between these things.</li>
<li>Why? The biblical understanding of covenant reflects the paradox of human relationships. If two people start a relationship saying: &quot;I will be what I should be to you if/to the degree that you are what you should be to me.&quot; There isn&#39;t any intimacy in these relationships - because neither person wants to give up their independence. </li>
<li>If instead each person says &quot;I will be what I should be to you, whether you are or aren&#39;t.&quot; If the two people say to each other that they&#39;re going to put each other&#39;s needs ahead of their own, the paradox is that that&#39;s the relationship where intimate feelings can grow. Why? Because it&#39;s safe. The more commited the relationship is, the more intimate it will get. Because the more I see someone saying ot me, &quot;I&#39;m going to be to you what you need, whether you are to me or not,&quot; I can be weak, I can share, I can open up. Only, and to the degree, tha tyou are willing to give up your independence can you know the freedom of an intimate relationship. That&#39;s the paradox. The more binding, the more intimate. That&#39;s a covenental relationship.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the new covenant?

<ul>
<li>God talks about the old covenant (binding relationship) he had with the house of Israel - but it was very religious. v9: They did not remain faithful to my covenant, so I turned away from them. </li>
<li>That&#39;s religion. In religion you set up a conditional, selfish business relationship with a diety. You&#39;re saying that you&#39;ll be the good moral religious person you should be, as long as God blesses you and keeps you happy. No intimacy.</li>
<li>But the new covenant isn&#39;t religion. v12: &quot;I will forgive their wickedness and remember their sin no more.&quot; This is the opposite. Unconditional - and a place for intimacy.</li>
<li>How can it be unconditional? Well, how does a covenental relationship get started? One person looks at the other and says &quot;I will be faithful to you, even if you&#39;re not faithful to me.&quot; Where did God say that? On the cross. After that, instead of God seeing our sin and turning away from us, he saw us and turned away from our sin. On teh cross, he turned away from Jesus. On the cross, Jesus was foresaken - that&#39;s the covenant curse of verse 9. Jesus took the curse so we could get the blessing.</li>
<li>We said the more binding a relationship is the more intimate it can be? Jesus bound himself to us - he nailed himself.</li>
<li>Sometimes we think we&#39;re doing all the right things but our lives are going miserably. We look at our neighbor who isn&#39;t trying hard, and his life is swell. We get bitter towards God and ask the quesiton: &quot;What has God done for me lately?&quot;&quot; But when we realize What Jesus has done for us on the cross, when we are changed by it and brought into a new covenant relationship with God, will never ask this question. God unconditionally loves me, now I unconditionally love him. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do you know if you&#39;re in this new covenant relationship? How do you know if you&#39;ve broken out of religion, the default mode of the human heart? There&#39;s three marks:

<ol>
<li>Intimacy rather than formalism (&quot;They will all know me&quot;)</li>
<li>In religion, there&#39;s no intimacy with God. It&#39;s a week by week thing, a renewable contract. I&#39;m doing my best, so on. But do you know Him? Not know about him, but know him? Have you ever experienced his love on your heart as an overwhelming encounter? Have you ever read scripture and found, instead of abstract concepts, some of the things the bible says become alive?</li>
<li>Equality rather than classism (&quot;From the least to the greatest&quot;)</li>
<li>The old temples had barriers between jews/gentiles, men/women, etc. Matthew 1, geneology of Jesus: women, foreigners, prostitutes. Religion leads to conflict because it&#39;s based on the idea that <em>you</em> are bridging the gap. 

<ul>
<li>If you base your identity on being a hard-working person, you will despise people who are lazy. Same with if you base your identity on being a moral religious person - you will look down on people who you perceive as immoral and without religion. This is why religion leads to conflict. But if you belive you&#39;re saved by grace, from teh least to hte greatest there is no difference. We&#39;re all equally lost, and equally loved.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Community rather than individualism (&quot;They will all be my people&quot;)</li>
<li>Notice it doesn&#39;t say you that you will be a new individual among many. It says that God is creating a new community of people. </li>
<li>When God created the world, he then created the people. Jesus is a King - through redemption, he&#39;s recreating the people (and then later on will design a new world for us to live in). So the people of God is the new humanity. </li>
<li>The new covenant creates covenental people who look at the church, look at their brothers and sisters and say, &quot;These are flawed. But I&#39;m going to be true to them, I&#39;m going to be commited to them, even if they&#39;re not always being what they ought to be to me.&quot;</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h2>5. Closing</h2>

<p>If God is this personal, it&#39;s both a wonderful invitation, and a frightening responsibility. CS Lewis: &quot;An impersonal God, well and good. A subjective God of beauty, truth and goodness inside my head, better still. A formless life force surging through us all, a vast divine power which we can all tap into, that&#39;s wonderful. But a livign God, a personal God, approaching at infinite speed, the hunter, the king, the lover, that is quite anotehr matter. There comes a moment when people who have been dabbling in religion suddenly draw back, realizing &#39;what if we actually find him? Worse yet, what if he finds us?&#39; IF there is a God, you are in a sense, alone with him. You cannot put him off with speculations about your neighbor&#39;s hypocrasy, or memories about what you have read in books. What will all that chatter and heresay count for when the anesthetic fog we call the real world fades away and the divine presence in which you have always stood becomes palpable, immmediate, and unavoidable?&quot;</p>

<p>If God&#39;s personal, you have to relate to him. But if God is this personal, why wouldn&#39;t you want to relate to him?</p>
