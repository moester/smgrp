		<h2>Outline</h2>
		<div id="outline-content">
			<h2>1. Audience</h2>

<ul>
<li>Hebrews was written to urban Christians

<ul>
<li>Living in a pluralistic society, like ours</li>
<li>Christian commitment brought marginalization</li>
<li>Christians are sufferring because of this</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Main theme of Hebrews</h2>

<ul>
<li>If God is committed to our Joy and our glory, why is our life so hard?

<ul>
<li>Hebrews&#39; answer: life is a journey</li>
<li>And the only way you&#39;re going to get home is by fixing your eyes on Jesus</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>3. This week&#39;s lesson</h2>

<p>These verses discuss:  </p>

<ol>
<li>What Jesus brings: the final word<br></li>
<li>How he brings it<br></li>
<li>And why it changes our lives<br></li>
</ol>

<h2>4. What Jesus brings</h2>

<h3>What scripture says</h3>

<ul>
<li>(Verse 1) Not just the word of God, but the final word</li>
<li>(Verse 3) &quot;...the Son is the exact representation of his being&quot;

<ul>
<li>Greek word here is &#39;character&#39;<br></li>
<li>God&#39;s not giving us &#39;general&#39; information about himself; he&#39;s actually telling us about his character<br>

<ul>
<li>He wants a relationship with us - how wonderful! We have a personal god who wants to engage our minds and our heart<br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>God gives us his final word</h3>

<ul>
<li>Notice the contrasts?<br>

<ul>
<li>In the past, God spoke to our fathers at <strong>many</strong> times and in <strong>various</strong> ways. This Greek term for various ways is <em>polytropos</em>, which actually means &#39;in pieces&#39;. So in the past, God spoke in piecemeal ways - but now he does so in one way, through Jesus<br></li>
<li>The author also says, rather boldly: &#39;In these last days he has spoken to us&#39;.</li>
<li>Last days refers to the entire period from when he was writing, to the end of time<br></li>
<li>What is this saying? From now until the end of time, there is no more final expression of God than Jesus. Full stop: there&#39;s nothing further, this is it.<br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Finalities in relationships</h3>

<ul>
<li>God giving us his final word is wonderful, because he wants to communicate with us, but it&#39;s hard too, because &#39;that&#39;s the way it is&#39;<br>

<ul>
<li>Actually, if we think about it, this is the way all personal relationships work</li>
<li>In a nutshell: <strong>there&#39;s no intimacy without finality</strong></li>
<li>What is Keller saying here? <strong>Analogy</strong>: consider marriage. You first marry, and think the other person can never make you angry, you two will never disagree. But then the fact that there are two wills at work emerges. The other person disagrees with you, rejects your opinions. They cross your will and contradict you. You don&#39;t like it. What do you do? At some point, you realize that there are a lot of things you can get the other person to negotiate with and back off of, but at a certain point you realize there are some finalities, some things that just aren&#39;t going to change because that that&#39;s just the way they are. At some point, you realize that if you cannot accept those finalities, you cannot have a personal relationship, and that relationship is over. So you learn to adjust, because you want intimacy, but <strong>you want intimacy with a person and that person has a will</strong>. </li>
<li>Think about the Stepford wives. The men try to overcome these finalities &amp; non-negotiables by putting microchips in the women&#39;s brains. The women never disagreed with the men, and did whatever they wanted them to: clean the house, cook and be happy in the kitchen, etc. But it wasn&#39;t perfect, because the personal relationship was gone. The men weren&#39;t getting any intimacy.</li>
<li>So <strong>there is no intimacy without adjusting to the other person&#39;s finalities</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tolerance in religion</h3>

<p>How often do we hear the following about God?  </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;I like this about God, but not this. We can&#39;t believe this thing anymore, with our modern sensibilities.&quot;<br></li>
<li>But the bible is God speaking to us.<br></li>
<li>If you don&#39;t accept this, consider this: How will this God of yours ever contradict you? Ever cross your will, ever tell you anything you don&#39;t want to hear? You don&#39;t want to belive this thing about God and you don&#39;t like that thing - fine. But have you put a microchip in your God? Do you have a real God, a God who can contradict you, or do you have a God who&#39;s happy in the kitchen, whipping up whatever you want? How will your God ever tell you something that offends your modern sensibilities? How will that happen? It can&#39;t - unless you accept the authority of the word of God. Unless you&#39;re willing to admit there&#39;s some finalities about God. <strong>There&#39;s some things about him that even though you don&#39;t like it, you have to adjust - otherwise you can&#39;t have an intimate personal relationship with him.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Why can Jesus bring us the final word?</h2>

<h3>He <em>is</em> the final word (verse 3)</h3>

<ul>
<li>In the old testament, when Moses begins to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt, a fiery cloud appears, in the form of a pillar. It is so powerful that it stops the Egyptian army. When it comes down on Mt. Sinai, no one can touch the mountain, or they die. It also comes later on, when the temple is dedicated under King Solomon.

<ul>
<li>What is the cloud? It&#39;s the glory of God. It&#39;s God in a form we can see, that expresses his overwhelming importance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But we&#39;re being told here that Jesus is the <em>ultimate</em> way that god appears. God in human form is the exact form of God - there&#39;s nothing greater than this.<br></li>
<li>Why? 2nd Corinthians 3 tells us: &quot;Whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away...when we, with unveiled faces reflect the Lord&#39;s glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever increasing glory, that comes from the Lord who is the spirit&quot;.

<ul>
<li>What does this mean? <strong>Analogy</strong>: have you ever spent a lot of time with someone who is so far beyond you, so much more kind, confident, noble, and wise? These kinds of people change you. Even when you gaze at them, it changes you. When you see how they treat people who disagree with them and you contrast it with you, how they express themselves, carry themselves, how they do things - you feel embarassed, and it changes you. You&#39;re gazing on what&#39;s good about them and it&#39;s passing into you.</li>
<li>How much more for the glory of god? How did people feel when they saw the pillar of smoke, or the burning bush? But Christ is the perfect form of God&#39;s glory, in a form you can have a personal relationship with</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Personal implication</h3>

<p>Remember, Hebrews is written to a city much like our own. There&#39;s a &#39;tyranny of tolerance&#39;. But the author is saying, don&#39;t back off of Christ&#39;s exclusivity.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(Verse 1) You can&#39;t put Jesus on a shelf with everyone else. His claims put him either above them or below them. What are some of his claims?</p>

<ul>
<li>In Luke 10, Jesus says &#39;I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning.&#39; </li>
<li>Matthew 23:34, Jesus says almost offhandedly, &#39;I keep sending you prophets, wise men and teachers&#39;. Notice he doesn&#39;t say <strong>I</strong> am a great prophet - he says I am the <strong>force</strong> that sent the prophets</li>
<li>All the other prophets in the bible say: &#39;Thus sayeth the lord&#39;. Jesus never says that. He always says, &#39;Truly truly, <strong>I</strong> say to you&#39;.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Christianity is either true, and Jesus is Life itself come to earth for our salvation, or it&#39;s a complete sham. If it&#39;s not a sham, everything in your life has to revolve around Christ. There is nothing in the middle. Christ forces us to be exteme - extremely loving and humble, because that&#39;s who he was, but extremeley commited to him.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Global implication</h3>

<p>People say we won&#39;t have global peace until all religions stop claiming to be right, and admit they are all equally valid. Why is this wrong?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The only way that all religions could be equal or valid is if you assume (1) there is no God, or (2) that there&#39;s a God who doesn&#39;t hold people accountable for what they believe. </p>

<ul>
<li>If you say the first, then all religions are equally invalid. Don&#39;t pretend to be tolerant, you&#39;re claiming they&#39;re false.</li>
<li>If the second, you&#39;re making a specific claim about God&#39;s character - namely, that he doesn&#39;t hold people accountable for what they believe. Your&#39;e saying that your interpretation is correct, and everyone else&#39;s conception of God (for example, that he prefers people to act a certain way) is incorrect. So you yourself are not being tolerant - you&#39;re contradicting yourself.<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hiding exclusive claims under a blanket of tolerance is not the path to global peace. So what is?</p>

<ul>
<li>Martin Luther Kingm Jr. knew. He told racist southern Christians that they needed to become <em>more</em> Christian, not less! The heart of the gospel teaches us to love those who are different. That&#39;s how you lead to tolerance, love and embrace.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>6. How can we experience Christ&#39;s transforming glory in our lives?</h2>

<h3>Obssess over Jesus&#39; message: the gospel (Chapter 2)</h3>

<p>In Verse 1, the &#39;pay careful attention&#39; part is important. 
  - &#39;Attention&#39; literally means obsession, &#39;more careful&#39; means furious
  - So we should be furiously obsessed with Christ
  - The journey to Christ is long. At the beginning, you&#39;ve only just begun to become what God can make you. You don&#39;t move on - you become furiously obsessed with the message of Christ - the gospel - and work it into your life.</p>

<h3>Realize that God&#39;s grace is the only way (verse 2)</h3>

<p>The old message given by angels was the law given at Mount Sinai. Also, there was punishment for violating the law (remember Leviticus?). How much more punishment will there be if we neglect the gospel? Jesus is not another prophet saying, here&#39;s how to get to God. <strong>He is God, and he&#39;s saying, come to me!</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Analogy</strong>: People used to seal envelopes by warming wax, and pressing a stamp with a seal onto the wax, then onto the envelope. The wax became permanently imprinted with the seal. But what would happen if you tried to do this without melting the wax? One of two things: a superficial imprint on the surface, or the wax might break.</p>

<ul>
<li>The point: if you just try to get the glory of God into your life by obeying the law, only two things can happen:

<ol>
<li>You can succeed and be a pretty good person on the outside, but on the inside be filled with pride and insecurity (like the superficial seal on the surface of the wax)</li>
<li>You can try to live up to the law, and it can break you, and make you feel like a failure<br></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>What Jesus did on the cross has to change your heart</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Earlier we made the point that you have to adjust to God&#39;s finalities in order to have a relationship with him. But what about God - aren&#39;t relationships two-way? Shouldn&#39;t He have to adjust to our finalities? </li>
<li>He did - on the cross!<br>

<ul>
<li>What is our finality that he adjusted to? We&#39;re sinners. <strong>The only way for a holy God to relate to us was to adjust to that</strong>. When he became a weak human being and died on the cross, Christ was adjusting to us.<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li>An interesting observation: on the cross, Jesus was silent. All of his life, he was in constant communication with the Father, talking, preaching, praying. But on the cross, he was silent. He severed his relationship with the Father. Why? He was taking what we deserved, so that <em>we</em> could have God, so <em>we</em> could have a relationship. See how much God adjusted! What he asks from us is nothing compared to what he gave us.<br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So, obsess on what Christ did for you on the cross. That will change you on the inside. It shows you that you&#39;re not saved by living a good life. It&#39;s the glory of God that will really change you.</p>
