			<h2>1. Refresher</h2>

<ul>
<li>Question that Hebrews answers: Why is our life so hard?</li>
<li>Answer: Focus on Jesus</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Summary of this lesson</h2>

<ul>
<li>Jesus is our King - who gets involved with us</li>
<li>Jesus is our Captain - who faces death for us</li>
<li>Jesus is our Brother - who is proud of us</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Jesus is our King, who gets involved with us</h2>

<ul>
<li>Chapter 1 was about how lofty Jesus was</li>
<li>But this chapter is the opposite - discusses how low Jesus made himself

<ul>
<li><strong>Analogy</strong>: there was a woman stabbed in New York in the 60&#39;s. 38 people heard her scream, turned on their lights, and looked down from their buildings and saw her. But they didn&#39;t do anything - they didn&#39;t want to get involved. Once the assailant realized these, he went back, robbed her of $49 and killed her.</li>
<li>Jesus has heard our screams - but he doesn&#39;t just look down, he comes down, and not at the risk of his life, but at the cost of his life.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Verse 11, 14, 17, 18 - Jesus becomes like us.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Jesus is our Captain, who faces death for us</h2>

<ul>
<li>The story of Christianity is something like</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p>Here&#39;s what we were made to be</p>

<ul>
<li>We were made to be stewards of creation</li>
<li>God gave us power to make things right and just

<ul>
<li>Verses 5-8, quotes Psalm 8 which looks back to creation + man&#39;s purpose.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Here&#39;s what happened to us</p>

<ul>
<li>God made the world to be under us, but sin ruined this

<ul>
<li>Last part of verse 8: &quot;at present we do not see everything under our feet&quot;. Points back to Genesis 3, when humans decided to be their own lords, to serve themselves rather than God</li>
</ul></li>
<li>That&#39;s why we don&#39;t see justice and peace and harmony when we look out at the world</li>
<li>Verses 14 and 15 are the biggest problem: &quot;we&#39;re in bondage to the fear of death&quot;

<ul>
<li>Freud said that humans have deeply ambivalent feelings towards death. He said that on the one hand we have a death wish (because we think we&#39;re not living up to what we ought to), and on the other hand we have an enormous fear of death. Freud says that we simply suppress the whole conflict, and don&#39;t admit there&#39;s actually a problem.</li>
<li>When people come to a realization about death, it has drastic effects. Leo Tolstoy said: &quot;Something strange began to happen to me at age 50. I had a wife who loved me, and whom I loved. I had a large estate which without much effort on my part increased. My name was respected. I enjoyed physical strength. And yet I could not live, becasue of death. The question, which brouht me to the verge of suicide sought an answer without which one cannot live: is there any meaning in life that my inevitable death does not destroy? Today or tomorrow death will come to those I love and then to me. Soon not only will I not exist, but eventually no one will exist who will remember anything I have ever written or done. Why then go on with the effort? What is it all for? What does it all lead to? What difference will it make whether I do this thing rather than that thing or nothing at all? So I could give no rational meaning to any single action or even to my whole life.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Death means that ultimately, our lives are meaningless. Deep down we know this, which is why we seek wealth, comforts, entertainment. Because we&#39;re trying to convince ourselves that our lives matter.</li>
<li>We&#39;re in bondage to the fear of death, and we don&#39;t even know it.

<ul>
<li>Verse 14, the devil uses the fear of death</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Here&#39;s what God is doing about it</p>

<ul>
<li>Jesus!</li>
<li>Verse 9. Jesus suffers. This enhances, not lessens, his glory.</li>
<li>Psalm 8 is not true of us, but it&#39;s true of Jesus

<ul>
<li>How? Verse 10: &#39;...founder of their salvation&#39;, this word should really be &#39;Champion&#39; (William Lane). What&#39;s a champion? Someone who engages in representative combat.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How? Verse 14: Jesus died, but he rose.</li>
<li>We got a person, not a religion. He is our captain - he&#39;s faced death for us.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>5. Jesus is our Brother, who is proud of us</h2>

<ul>
<li>verse 11

<ul>
<li>Actually, this may be hard for us to understand. We don&#39;t value family as much as other cultures. Geneologies used to be like resumes! And Jesus says he is part of our family.

<ul>
<li>Matthew 1, Jesus&#39; geneology, recommending him to the world. Who&#39;s there?</li>
<li>4 or 5 women. Low status to begin with, but look at who they were

<ul>
<li>Tamar, incest survivor</li>
<li>Bathsheeba, adulteress</li>
<li>Rahab, prostitute</li>
<li>Mary, unwed single mother</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Morally, should be ashamed of these people. But Jesus gives them a place in the geneology of the king of the universe.</li>
<li>Doesn&#39;t matter who you are or what you&#39;ve done - through the death of Christ, you can be part of his eternal family.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Putting this together</h2>

<ol>
<li>What are you afraid of?

<ul>
<li>The future? Jesus has gone into the future and secured the world for us, made the world the way it&#39;s supposed to be.</li>
<li>The past? In Jesus Christ, it is over.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discouraged about your troubles?

<ul>
<li>Our God isn&#39;t too good for you. He doesn&#39;t reject you and boom answers to our suffering from on high, he comes down, experiences rejection, torture, and suffering - he&#39;s there with us.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But why does he let me suffer?

<ul>
<li>Jesus&#39; glory was enhanced by his suffering. Why? There&#39;s nothing more beautiful than someone giving up their beauty so we can be lovely to God. When we suffer and walk in the same path as Jesus, a path into greatness, into wisdom, compassion, love, and greatness with God, this is what&#39;s happening. </li>
<li>Boromir is an allegory for the average Christian. He was going to be head of Gondor, until he met Aragorn, the heir to the throne. He struggles with this first, but by the end of the movie, he repents, and as he&#39;s dying he looks to Aragorn and says &quot;I would have followed you to the end, my brother, my captain, my King&quot;.

<ul>
<li>That&#39;s how we feel when we get near Jesus. He&#39;s the heir to the throne of our life, and at first we reject him, but if we repent and submit to him, that is our path to royalty</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>So look to Jesus, in spite of all your troubles, and pledge to follow him. When you do, the result will not be death, but eternal life.</li>
</ol>
