			<h2>Quiz</h2>

<p>What was the monument/memorial of the US that Jerry mentioned to introduce Leviticus this week?<br>
 a: liberty bell
 b: lincoln memorial
 c: bunker hill monument
 d: ethan allen tomb</p>

<h2>Leviticus 25</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sabbath year - define  (6 years sow/gather.  don’t sow or prune, or reap or harvest.)<br></li>
<li>define sabbath perhaps?</li>
<li>1 day a week, and 1 year out of 7.  let the land rest</li>
<li>how will we eat?

<ul>
<li>god will send such a blessing in 6th year that the’ll eat for the next 3.</li>
<li>still be eating from it when the harvest from the 9th year comes in.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>why?  god is teaching the nations around israel something about himself</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jubilee</h2>

<ul>
<li>count off 7 sabbaths of years 7x7 years, blow trumpets on day of atonement, consecrate the 50th year and proclaim liberty to all inhabitants.<br></li>
<li>dont sow, or reap.</li>
<li>jubilee is to be holy</li>
<li>Freedom or release from bondage

<ul>
<li>Reset!

<ul>
<li>property given back</li>
<li>slaves freed (hired workers essentially)</li>
<li>debts forgiven</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Application</h2>

<ul>
<li>everything is Gods, and he can be trusted (leave the land alone, god will provide)</li>
<li>hope and justice isnt too far away - jubilee is coming. great reset (fall on hard times, sell property, sell themselves)</li>
<li>God’s economy is more relational than financial.  (begins on day of Atonement)</li>
</ul>

<h2>No Jubilee</h2>

<ul>
<li>Israel has no record of ever keeping the Jubilee.</li>
<li>2 Chron 36 - land enjoyed its sabbath rest (70 years).  time from israel stopped observing till exile - 490 years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other scriptures</h2>

<ul>
<li>Isaiah 61

<ul>
<li>Lord has appointed me to proclaim the year of the Lords favor (Jubilee)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Luke 4

<ul>
<li>Jesus as Guest Rabbi - stops at “to proclaim the year of the Lords Favor”.  Stops.  Today, this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.  I am the Jubilee!</li>
<li>I can free you from the sin that holds you in bondage.<br></li>
<li>I can release you from all of your debts</li>
<li>I can make everything new</li>
<li>I can reset you into the image in which you were designed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Matthew 1:17

<ul>
<li>14 gens from abraham to david, 14 from david to exile in babylon, and 14 from exile to the Christ.  3 14s, 6 7s.   *Jesus is the 7th 7.  He is the Jubilee.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Hey there Pastor Jerry,
You mentioned in a Leviticus sermon that Matthew 1:17 states that there are 14 generations from Abraham to David, 14 generations from David to the exile, and 14 from the exile to the Messiah.  So three14s, or six 7s - where Jesus is the seventh 7 (or the Jubiliee).  But wouldn&#39;t that make him instead the 43rd generation and not the Jubilee?<br>
My small group has been studying Leviticus through the Distinct series from the Chapel.  This week is the sermon on Jubilee, and I know some have already asked this question.</p>

<p>Hi Dave:</p>

<p>Matthew was employing a literary device more than anything.  His genealogy (which likely skipped some generations as most all ancient genealogies did) was to show this was a real event and that the Messiah is the &quot;seventh seven&quot; (in terms of how he ordered his gospel).  John does something similar in ordering the miracles in his gospel - its common practice in the ancient world.  so, read it as a literary aficianado more than a scientist :-). This isn&#39;t a math formula, it&#39;s a literary device to show that Jesus is the ultimate perfection, the perfect rest, and the Savior from sin.  He is the Jubilee.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.  Say hi to your group for me.</p>

<p>Grace and Peace,</p>
