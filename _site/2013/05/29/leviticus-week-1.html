		<h2>Outline</h2>
		<div id="outline-content">
			<ol>
<li><p>Leviticus is important. Mentioned 40 times in NT, by Paul, Peter, Jesus. So important for us to understand it.</p></li>
<li><p>Purpose of Leviticus</p>

<ul>
<li>Exodus 19, God tells Moses how he wants his people to be. “You will be a Kingdom of priests and a holy nation”. Leviticus starts at the foot of Mt. Sinai, it’s about what God is trying to teach Israel.</li>
<li>They build a tabernacle, which means dwell with God. But how can a sinful people dwell with a holy God?</li>
<li>So Leviticus is: instructions on how Israel can dwell with God on God’s terms in such a way that they won’t be consumed by the holiness of God</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Theme of Leviticus</p>

<ul>
<li>God is Holy and He wants a Holy people; or</li>
<li>God is distinct - and He wants a distinct people</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Outline of the chapters</p>

<ul>
<li>Chs. 1-5 outline the offerings. These are from the perspective of the offerer.</li>
<li>Chs. 6-7 reoutline the offerings. These are from the perspective of the priests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The offerings</p>

<ul>
<li>Burnt offering (Ch. 1)</li>
<li>Grain offering (2)</li>
<li>Peace offering (3)</li>
<li>Sin offering (4)</li>
<li>Guilt offering (5:14)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A classification for the offerings  </p>

<ul>
<li>Offerings of consecration (setting apart, choosing to make holy). These are free will offerings.</li>
<li><em>Burnt</em>. The animal gets consumed completely. This is representative of an Israelite coming to God and giving themselves to God completely. Also representative of a grateful heart. Also a reminder that they didn’t want any other idols taking their place - consume them all.</li>
<li><em>Grain</em>. This was a reminder of an Israelite coming to the Lord and saying, everything I have made with my hands is yours.</li>
<li>Offerings of communion.</li>
<li><em>Fellowship/peace offering</em>. Because of all you’ve done for me, I willingly offer this to you. A reminder that because of what you’ve done, I can be at one with the people around me.</li>
<li>Offerings of propitiation (turn aside the wrath of God)</li>
<li><em>Sin</em> offering</li>
<li><em>Guilt</em> offering</li>
<li>A way to remember which offering belongs to which category: who eats it? If it’s a consecration offering, God consumes it. If it’s a fellowship offering, the offerer and the priest consume it. If it’s a propitiation offering, only the priest eats it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How does this apply to us today? It applies to God’s people - a distinct people</p>

<ul>
<li>Distinct people are serious about worship. One key word we see over and over again, the people are bringing sacrifice. They’re bringing offering.</li>
<li>When we talk about worship today, we usually talk about how we feel, about the service or the music. But worship in Leviticus was about sacrificing. For example, they had to sacrifice an animal from their own herd. Consider sacrificing your family pet, a pet you’ve known and raised and care for. God wants us to be willing to offer that to him, because it’s an expression that everything we have is his.</li>
<li>God is serious about worship. And worship involves sacrifice.</li>
<li>We see this in Acts, when Paul is in Ephesus. Paul is casting demons out of people. The seven sons of Sceva try to cast out a demon, but the demon says he doesn’t even know them. When the people see Paul casting demons out, they get their scrolls that they were practicing from, and burn them. The scrolls were very valuable.</li>
<li>We also come with grateful hearts. We see this in the NT as well, in Matthew. The woman pours perfume on Jesus. She sacrificed out of gratitude. She was serious about worship.</li>
<li>Distinct people are serious about sin.</li>
<li>The sacrifices in Leviticus 1-7 is not for the forgiveness of sin. The sacrifices were given to them by God so that they could approach God and not be consumed. This wasn’t for the forgiveness and cleansing of sins. Look at Ch. 5: the sins are inadvertent, accidental, ignorant things that make them clean.</li>
<li>King David, after committing adultery and murder, says in Psalm 51, speaking to God, “You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it. You want a broken and contrite heart.” So David knew that sacrifices didn’t cleanse his sins.</li>
<li>There was no sacrifice for intentional sin. If God requires a sacrifice for unintentional sin, how much more serious is he about premeditated sin?</li>
<li>Distinct people are serious about grace motivating holiness.</li>
<li>The law was grace to the Israelites. It came after God delivered them to the promised land. God could have consumed them in their sinfulness, but he gave them the law.</li>
<li>Grace is what we experience in Jesus Christ. So where blood of goats and calves cannot save, God has made another way. God doesn’t wink at sin; there is no grace without wrath, righteousness and justice. That’s what makes God’s grace so amazing.

<ul>
<li>This is what Hebrews tells us (Ch. 10). Sacrifices are an annual reminder of sin, because it’s impossible for them to cleanse sin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This is how the sacrifices pointed towards Jesus. God was the only one who could cleanse our sin, by his grace he did, and he paid the cost. The grace of God is the motivation for us to be a people who live distinct and holy. This is the idea that Paul had when he wrote to Rome. He had the idea of the sacrificial system, that it was pointing to the grace of God. Romans 12:1: “Therefore, offer your bodies as living sacrifices, for this is your spiritual worship.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
